# Grokking the Coding Interview Questions

Author: Adrian Huebner *(wrote code for the problems that I was given)*

## Summary
----
Grokking the interview allows programmers to study over 100 different challenges which are broken up into 16 different sections

I am going to be writing both in Javascript which I studied during my time at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) and Java which I have both been teaching myself and learned via [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/)
